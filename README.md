# Docker Node

This repository contains Node parent Docker image source code for Defra.

Two parent images are created from this repository:

- defra-node
- defra-node-development

It is recommended that services use [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build) to produce production and development images, each extending the appropriate parent, from a single Dockerfile.

[Examples](./example) are provided to show how parent images can be extended for different types of services. These should be a good starting point for building Node services conforming to FFC standards.

## Versioning

Images should be tagged according to the Dockerfile version and the version of Node on which the image is based. For example, for Dockerfile version `1.0.0` based on Node `12.16.0`, the built image would be tagged `1.0.0-node12.16.0`.

## Example files

`Dockerfile.web` - This is an example web project, that requires a build step to create some static files that are used by the web front end.

`Dockerfile.service` - This is an example project that doesn't expose any external ports (a message based service). There is also no build step in this Dockerfile.
